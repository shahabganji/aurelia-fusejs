This is not working atm, ( I have no clue what Im doing)


* ```npm install``` on root
* ```npm install && jspm install``` under sample


* ```gulp build``` to build plugin
* ```gulp watch``` to run sample


---
When running gulp watch it builds the plugin to "dev" catalog on root, then it builds the sample and loads plugin in the index.html
